# Machine Learning Projects Showcase

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I present two distinct machine learning projects. These projects cover house price prediction and iris flower species classification. The datasets for these projects were sourced from Kaggle.

## Task 1: House Price Prediction

**Overview:**
In this project, I've developed a machine learning model to predict house prices using Python,scikit-learn and TensorFlow. The Colab notebook contains the following key components:
- Data Preprocessing
- Data Visualization
- Conversion of Categorical Features to Numeric
- Min-Max Scaling of Numeric Features
- Data Splitting (Train-Test)
- Model Building
- Evaluation Metrics Calculation
- Making Predictions on New Data

The code for this project is available in the Houseüè° Price Prediction..ipynb file.


## Task 3: Iris Classification

**Overview:**
In this project, I've constructed a model to classify different species of iris flowers based on the length of their petals and sepals using Python,scikit-learn and TensorFlow. The Colab notebook involves the following steps:
- Data Preprocessing
- Data Visualization
- Encoding Categorical Data (Species Column)
- Data Splitting (Train-Test)
- Model Development
- Evaluation Metrics Calculation
- Making Predictions on New Data

The code for this project can be accessed in the Iris Classification.ipynb file.

## Datasets

The datasets for these projects were sourced from Kaggle, a renowned platform for data science and machine learning enthusiasts. The specific datasets used in these projects are available on Kaggle.
